The forms section provides basic styling of form elements in addition to a basic reset.

Labels for form elements should describe what the field is, while placeholder text should describe the specifics about formatting or examples for the input text. Labels should **not** be followed by a semicolon.

Required form fields should be labeled with two things:

1. The `<label>` should include a red asterisk indicating visually that the field is required.
2. The `<input>` element should have both the `required` and `aria-required="true"` attributes.
