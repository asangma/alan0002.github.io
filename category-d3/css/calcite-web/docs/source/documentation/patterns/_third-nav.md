Tertiary navigation is necessary only when the information architecture of the site requires three levels of hierarchy within pages. A breadcrumb component can also be used in this pattern.

The third nav has a set of of Javascript bindings responsible for responsive behavior when the content of the third nav is greater than it's container.

Only a single third nav can be on a page.
