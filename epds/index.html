    <p><strong>Team:</strong> Routinely reach out to connect over your work and the work of others. Donâ€™t let the week go by without connecting with your peers.</p>
    <p><strong>Personal:</strong> By the end of August 2016, have regular and open conversations with ArcGIS Pro team members, Richard Caballero and Shari Little, in order to discover opportunities to improve user workflows between ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online.</p>
    <p><strong>Metric:</strong> Connect formally or casually at least once a week with at least one of the team members mentioned above (and other stakeholders) to share and discuss cross-product workflows.  Integrate shared knowledge into at least two design patterns in the ArcGIS API for Javascript.</p>
