    <p><strong>Team:</strong> Platform/Brand harmony benefits from our direct involvement. Take responsibility, leveraging tools like Calcite, Patterns, and collaborative design.</p>
    <p><strong>Personal:</strong> Improve brand alignment across Esri's platform by coordinating regular brain-storming and paired-design sessions with cross-product UX architects and UI Designers.  The goal of the sessions will be to further and broaden componentry in the Calcite repertoire.</p>
    <p><strong>Metric:</strong> Organize and facilitate a regular (bi-weekly or monthly) workshop with interactive UX architects and UI designers to share, review, align, and produce design patterns using structured design and ideation techniques.</p>
    <p><strong>Priority:</strong> 1</p>

    <h2 id="effective-teamwork">Effective Teamwork</h2>
    <p><strong>Team:</strong> Routinely reach out to connect over your work and the work of others. Donâ€™t let the week go by without connecting with your peers.</p>
    <p><strong>Personal:</strong> By the end of August 2016, have regular and open conversations with ArcGIS Pro team members, Richard Caballero and Shari Little, in order to discover opportunities to improve user workflows between ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online.</p>
    <p><strong>Metric:</strong> Connect formally or casually at least once a week with at least one of the team members mentioned above (and other stakeholders) to share and discuss cross-product workflows.  Integrate shared knowledge into at least two design patterns for the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and review these integrations with my lead, Steve Nelson.</p>
    <p><strong>Priority:</strong> 3</p>
